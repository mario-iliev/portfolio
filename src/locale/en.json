    "RESUME": "I am a {{years_old}} years old <b>senior frontend React developer</b> with about {{experience}} years of experience in the field.<br /> I had passion for drawing and computers when I was a kid and it grew into a freelance web design career. As a designer I had to gain some frontend knowledge and I got very excited about it. After several years of creating designs and doing frontend I decided to focus my career on programming. I found a great company with an amazing team, that helped me develop my JavaScript skills. At some point {{react_link}} got on my radar and sparked a new light in my programming passion. Now Iâ€™m focused on building applications with React and having fun and sense of fulfilment in my professional journey.",
    "ABOUT_SITE": "This domain was used for my business portfolio as a freelancer. Since I'm not offering freelance services anymore, I decided to create a new website to represent me as a frontend developer. That's why I chose to create an unsual design and challenged myself not to use images, making it entirely with <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> (Styled Components), <b>React.js</b> (with Hooks) and {{store_me_link}}. <span>Thank you for stopping by!</span>"
